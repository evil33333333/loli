If you have issues with pycurl, make sure you have Python 3.8 before you install.

Also, I written this script so people can read it and try to learn from it.

Other open source/private source Instagram turbos consist of the following:
 -> Poor variable and/or function names
 -> "Over-importing"
 -> 0 consideration for other operating systems
 -> Spaghetti code
 -> Horrible threading implementations
 -> Horrific and unnecessary if/else blocks 
 -> etc, etc...
 
 I hope this fixes those issues,
